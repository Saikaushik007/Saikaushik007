# Hi there 👋 I am Saikaushik N 

#  🚀About Me 
  I’m a passionate Computer Science Engineering student with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I enjoy building data-driven and intelligent solutions, combining analytical thinking with practical development to solve real-world problems. As a versatile and fast-learning developer, I’m comfortable adapting to new technologies and tech stacks, and I’ve gained valuable experience through technical events and hackathons, where I worked under tight timelines to deliver impactful and scalable solutions.
  
# 🏅 Notable Achievements : 

   * 🏆 Top 10 Finalist – Creonix 2025 (SRM Easwari Engineering College) with Decoders . 
   
# 📌 Featured Projects : 

1)   **Counterfeit Component Detection 🔍** :   AI-driven system for identifying counterfeit ICs and electronic connectors using visual inspection and electrical behavior analysis.

 * **🏆 Top 10 Finalist – Creonix National Level Hackathon @ SRM Easwari Engineering College, Ramapuram**

 * Implemented visual analysis tools including Label Detection and Scratch Detection to identify physical tampering and counterfeit   markings.

 * Developed an authenticity monitoring module (L293D IC) analyzing supply voltage, output voltage, current, temperature, and V/I     characteristics to flag abnormal behavior.

 * Integrated live data visualization for voltage drop history, current trends, and component health status, enabling quick and reliable authenticity verdicts.

   

2)  **SDI – Silent Deterioration Intelligence 🏥** -  AI-based predictive healthcare system for early detection of patient health deterioration before critical emergencies occur.

* Designed an AI-driven predictive healthcare monitoring system that analyzes continuous patient vitals and clinical data to identify silent deterioration before symptoms become visible.

* Implemented trend- and pattern-based ML models to predict patient risk hours in advance, overcoming limitations of threshold-based healthcare monitoring systems.

* nabled early clinical decision support by providing actionable healthcare risk insights to medical staff, helping prevent ICU transfers and emergency escalations.

3) **LexaFlow AI ⚖️** : Context-aware intelligent knowledge retrieval system for complex case management in high-stakes enterprise workflows.

* Built a just-in-time AI knowledge system that analyzes live case context (e.g., claim type, jurisdiction, policy category) to proactively surface relevant regulations, SOPs, and internal policies without interrupting agent workflows.

* Implemented context-aware retrieval across fragmented knowledge sources including government regulations, legal codes, policy PDFs, and legacy knowledge bases, significantly reducing manual search and average handling time (AHT).

* Designed a verifiable citation mechanism that links every AI-generated insight directly to the exact source document, page, and paragraph, ensuring compliance, auditability, and trust.
